# Architectural Decision Record (ADR) for Order Management Service

**Title:** Architectural Design for Microservices in Order Management Service (OMS)  
**Date:** December 29, 2024  
**Status:** Proposed

## Context

We are building an Order Management System (OMS) to handle the end-to-end order lifecycle for a business, including order creation, validation, fulfillment, payment processing, notifications, and order tracking. The system needs to be scalable, maintainable, and flexible enough to integrate with external systems such as inventory, shipping, payment, and catalog/product services. Additionally, the system should support high concurrency and provide robust real-time reporting for operational insights.

The business requires that the Order Management System be broken down into independent, loosely coupled microservices to ensure flexibility, fault tolerance, and scalability.

## Problem

The key challenge is how to architect the OMS in a way that ensures:

- Each part of the system (e.g., order processing, order tracking) can scale independently.
- Services are maintainable and deployable independently.
- Integration with external systems (Inventory, Shipping, Payment, etc.) is efficient.
- Decoupled communication between services is prioritized to avoid cascading failures.
- The system is highly available and can handle real-time updates.

The decision needs to address:

- Which microservices should be part of the OMS?
- How the microservices should communicate?
- The granularity of each microservice.
- Handling of events such as order creation, payment failures, and fulfillment updates.

## Decision

### Microservices Structure

The OMS will be broken down into the following microservices to adhere to single-responsibility principles, allowing each service to focus on a specific domain within the order lifecycle:

- **Order Processing Service**: Responsible for handling the creation and validation of orders.
- **Order Fulfillment Service**: Manages the shipment, packing, and delivery of orders.
- **Order Tracking Service**: Provides real-time tracking updates on the status of orders.
- **Order Payment Service**: Processes payments for orders and handles payment-related events.
- **Order Cancellation Service**: Manages cancellations, refunds, and returns of orders.
- **Order Notification Service**: Sends notifications to customers based on order events (e.g., order shipped, order delivered).
- **Order History Service**: Archives and manages access to past order records.
- **Order Reporting & Analytics Service**: Generates reports and provides insights on order trends and system performance.

### External Services Integration

While these microservices will be developed as part of the OMS, there will be dependencies on the following external services, which are not part of the OMS but with which the system must communicate:

- **Inventory Service**: Manages stock levels and product availability.
- **Payment Service**: Handles all payment transactions and refund processing.
- **Shipping Service**: Coordinates shipping and delivery processes.
- **Catalog/Product Service**: Manages product data and pricing details.
- **Customer Service**: Manages customer profiles and addresses.

### Communication Patterns

To ensure flexibility and decoupling between services, the following patterns will be adopted:

- **Event-Driven Communication**: Services will communicate asynchronously through events. For example, after an order is created, the Order Processing Service will emit an event that can be consumed by the Order Fulfillment Service, Order Notification Service, and others.  
  We will use a message broker such as Kafka or RabbitMQ to handle these events.

- **Synchronous APIs**: For services that require real-time communication (e.g., payment validation between Order Payment Service and Payment Service), we will expose RESTful APIs for synchronous calls.

- **Circuit Breakers & Retries**: To ensure the system's fault tolerance, we will implement circuit breakers and retries for inter-service communication. If a service is down or unresponsive, the system will not propagate the failure but will handle it gracefully by queuing or retrying failed requests.

### Granularity and Boundaries

The granularity of microservices has been determined based on domain-driven design (DDD) principles:

- Each service is responsible for a single business domain and communicates with other services through events or API contracts.
- Services can scale independently and are loosely coupled to ensure maintainability.

### API Gateway

To simplify client interaction, we will use an API Gateway to route requests to the appropriate microservice. This will:

- Aggregate services and provide a single entry point for clients.
- Provide load balancing, authentication, and request routing.

### Service Discovery

For microservice-to-microservice communication, we will use a Service Discovery mechanism like Consul or Eureka to dynamically locate services within the ecosystem.

## Reasoning

### Why Microservices?

- **Scalability**: By decoupling services, we allow each one to scale independently based on the load it handles (e.g., scaling the Order Processing Service during peak order times).
- **Independent Deployments**: Each microservice can be developed, tested, and deployed independently, reducing time-to-market for new features and bug fixes.
- **Fault Tolerance**: If one service fails (e.g., Order Payment Service), other services can continue functioning, preventing system-wide failures.
- **Maintainability**: Smaller, focused services are easier to maintain, debug, and extend over time.

### Why Event-Driven Architecture?

- **Loose Coupling**: Event-driven systems decouple services, meaning services don't need to know about each otherâ€™s internal workings.
- **Resilience**: By using asynchronous messaging, services can operate independently, even if some services are temporarily unavailable.
- **Scalability**: Event-driven systems can easily scale as the load grows by adding more consumers for particular events.

### Why an API Gateway?

- **Simplified Client Access**: The API Gateway provides a single endpoint for clients to interact with, simplifying the complexity of managing multiple microservice endpoints.
- **Security and Monitoring**: It allows for centralized security, rate-limiting, and monitoring of traffic across microservices.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Highly scalable and flexible architecture.
- Each microservice can be developed and deployed independently.
- Fault tolerance due to decoupled services.
- Real-time communication through event-driven design improves responsiveness.

### Negative

- Additional operational complexity, including managing distributed services, monitoring, and logging.
- Increased network traffic due to inter-service communication.
- Dependency on message broker infrastructure for event-driven communication, requiring careful management.

## Alternatives Considered

- **Monolithic Architecture**: A monolithic design was considered but rejected due to the scaling limitations and lack of flexibility for independent deployments.
- **Synchronous-Only Communication**: An architecture based purely on synchronous REST calls was considered but rejected due to the potential for cascading failures and tight coupling between services.

## Decision Outcome

The decision to use a microservices-based architecture with event-driven communication will ensure the OMS can meet business requirements for scalability, maintainability, and flexibility, while supporting complex workflows like order creation, payment processing, and fulfillment.

## Next Steps

- Define and design REST APIs for synchronous service calls.
- Set up the message broker (Kafka or RabbitMQ) to handle event-driven communication.
- Implement the API Gateway and service discovery.
- Begin the development of individual microservices following the outlined architecture.
