### Event-Driven Architecture with MassTransit and Mediator

#### Context
For enhanced scalability and decoupling between microservices, we aim to adopt an **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)** for inter-service communication within the Order Management Service (OMS). The EDA will allow services to react asynchronously to events and improve system responsiveness and resilience. Additionally, for internal service communication, we will use the **MassTransit library with the Mediator pattern**, ensuring a clean separation of concerns between services while maintaining transactional integrity through **MassTransit Sagas**.

#### Decision

1. **Event-Driven Communication with MassTransit**:
   We will use **MassTransit**, a widely adopted .NET message bus library, for handling event-driven communication between microservices. MassTransit will abstract message queuing, retries, and routing, allowing microservices to publish events (e.g., OrderCreated, PaymentProcessed) and consume them asynchronously.

2. **Internal Communication via Mediator**:
   For communication between services within a single microservice boundary (e.g., handling multiple internal operations related to order validation, inventory checking, or notification dispatching), the **Mediator pattern** will be used. This ensures internal services are decoupled and reduces direct dependencies, simplifying maintenance and scaling.

3. **Transaction Handling with MassTransit Sagas**:
   To ensure transactional integrity across multiple microservices and operations, **MassTransit Sagas** will manage long-running workflows. Sagas will help coordinate distributed transactions, ensuring that each step of a transaction (e.g., payment, order fulfillment) completes successfully or compensates for failures by reverting prior steps when necessary.

#### Reasoning

- **MassTransit** provides a robust mechanism to manage message-based communication, retries, and fault tolerance between services.
- The **Mediator pattern** enhances maintainability and separation of concerns within a service, ensuring that internal operations don't tightly couple different service layers.
- **Sagas** allow managing distributed transactions and eventual consistency in a way that guarantees reliability and fault recovery in the event of system failures.

#### Consequences

##### Positive
- **Decoupled Microservices**: Each service can evolve independently, with event-driven communication ensuring loose coupling.
- **Transactional Integrity**: Sagas provide strong guarantees around distributed transaction management, ensuring operations either fully complete or cleanly roll back.
- **Scalability**: Using MassTransit for asynchronous event-driven messaging allows scaling consumers based on load, improving overall system responsiveness.

##### Negative
- **Increased Complexity**: Introducing Sagas and managing distributed transactions adds complexity to system orchestration and monitoring.
- **Operational Overhead**: Message queue infrastructure (e.g., RabbitMQ) and event bus management will require careful monitoring and tuning for optimal performance.

#### Steps
1. Implement **MassTransit** with **RabbitMQ** as the message broker for inter-service communication.
2. Set up the **Mediator pattern** for internal command and query handling between service layers.
3. Implement **MassTransit Sagas** to coordinate distributed workflows and transaction handling across microservices.
4. Establish monitoring and logging mechanisms for tracking the state of distributed transactions and the health of the message broker.
