# Architectural Decision Record (ADR) for Microservice Architectures in Order Management Service (OMS)
**Title**: Microservice Architecture Patterns for OMS  
**Date**: January 4, 2025  
**Status**: Proposed

## Context
The Order Management System (OMS) will be developed using a microservices architecture to ensure scalability, maintainability, and flexibility. The system needs to handle various services such as order processing, payment, tracking, fulfillment, and reporting, each of which must operate independently and scale according to demand.

The question is how to structure each microservice for maximum performance, scalability, and maintainability while ensuring that each service is loosely coupled and can evolve independently.

## Problem
The challenge is to determine the appropriate architecture patterns for each microservice, considering their specific roles and interactions within the OMS. Key considerations include:

- **Scalability**: Ensuring that each microservice can scale independently based on its load.
- **Maintainability**: Keeping each service easy to maintain and evolve over time.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Ensuring that failure in one service doesn’t affect the entire system.
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Services need to react to various events from other services.
- **Domain Complexity**: Different services have varying levels of complexity, which may influence the chosen architecture pattern.

## Decision
The following architecture patterns are chosen for each microservice:

### 1. **Order Processing Service**
- **Pattern**: Onion Architecture / Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- **Justification**: The core business logic of order creation and validation needs to be isolated from external concerns. Using Onion Architecture ensures that the domain logic is at the center and independent of external frameworks and infrastructure.
- **Structure**:
    - **Core Layer**: Domain models and business rules (e.g., order creation, validation).
    - **Application Layer**: Orchestrates domain logic and application workflows.
    - **Infrastructure Layer**: External dependencies (e.g., Inventory and Catalog services).
    - **Presentation Layer**: Exposes APIs to interact with the outer layers.

### 2. **Order Fulfillment Service**
- **Pattern**: CQRS with Event-Driven Architecture
- **Justification**: The service needs to handle both command operations (e.g., ship an order) and query operations (e.g., check order status). CQRS allows us to separate reading and writing, and event-driven architecture ensures we can react to changes asynchronously.
- **Structure**:
    - **Command Side**: Handles ship and fulfill operations.
    - **Query Side**: Retrieves order statuses.
    - **Event Handlers**: Reacts to events (e.g., "order shipped").

### 3. **Order Tracking Service**
- **Pattern**: Microkernel Architecture with Event-Driven Communication
- **Justification**: The core tracking logic can be extended by integrating with external systems. Microkernel architecture allows easy extension without modifying the core logic.
- **Structure**:
    - **Core Tracking Engine**: Manages order status tracking.
    - **Plugins/External Systems**: Integrates with external services (e.g., shipping APIs).
    - **Event Handlers**: Reacts to events such as “order shipped”.

### 4. **Order Payment Service**
- **Pattern**: Layered Architecture
- **Justification**: The service requires a clear separation of concerns between handling incoming requests, business logic for processing payments, and integration with payment gateways.
- **Structure**:
    - **Presentation Layer**: API layer for payment requests.
    - **Business Logic Layer**: Payment processing and validation.
    - **Data Access Layer**: Interacts with payment systems.

### 5. **Order Cancellation Service**
- **Pattern**: CQRS
- **Justification**: Similar to Order Fulfillment, cancellation services have separate command and query operations. CQRS separates the complexities of handling cancellations and refunds from querying canceled orders.
- **Structure**:
    - **Command Side**: Handles cancellation and refund requests.
    - **Query Side**: Queries canceled order statuses.
    - **Event Handlers**: Reacts to cancellation events.

### 6. **Order Notification Service**
- **Pattern**: Microservices with Event-Driven Architecture
- **Justification**: The service reacts to events such as order status changes and triggers notifications (e.g., email, SMS). Event-driven architecture ensures the service is loosely coupled and reacts to changes asynchronously.
- **Structure**:
    - **Notification Engine**: Core logic for processing and sending notifications.
    - **Event Handlers**: Responds to events like “order shipped” or “payment completed”.

### 7. **Order History Service**
- **Pattern**: Repository Pattern with Event-Driven Architecture
- **Justification**: This service is responsible for storing historical data and handling the retrieval of past orders. The Repository Pattern allows for efficient data access, while event-driven communication ensures it stays updated with order lifecycle events.
- **Structure**:
    - **Repository Layer**: Manages historical data persistence.
    - **Event Handlers**: Listens to events like “order completed” and persists data.
    - **API Layer**: Exposes endpoints to query historical data.

### 8. **Order Reporting & Analytics Service**
- **Pattern**: Event Sourcing with CQRS
- **Justification**: Event sourcing allows us to store all events related to orders, enabling accurate historical reporting. CQRS separates the read and write operations for efficient querying and aggregation.
- **Structure**:
    - **Event Store**: Stores all events related to orders.
    - **Command Side**: Handles commands like “generate report”.
    - **Query Side**: Optimized for retrieving reports and insights.
    - **Event Handlers**: Processes events like “order created” or “payment completed”.

## Consequences
### Positive:
- **Scalability**: Each microservice can scale independently based on demand.
- **Maintainability**: Each microservice is focused on a specific domain, making it easier to maintain.
- **Flexibility**: The system can evolve by updating individual services without affecting others.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Failures in one microservice do not affect the overall system.
- **Real-Time Communication**: Event-driven communication allows the system to react to changes in real-time.

### Negative:
- **Operational Complexity**: Managing multiple microservices, distributed systems, and monitoring tools introduces operational complexity.
- **Increased Latency**: Network communication between services can introduce latency.
- **Dependency on Infrastructure**: The system depends on message brokers and service discovery mechanisms, which need careful management.

## Alternatives Considered
- **Monolithic Architecture**: Considered but rejected due to scaling limitations and lack of flexibility for independent deployments.
- **Synchronous-Only Communication**: Rejected due to potential for cascading failures and tight coupling between services.

## Steps
- Begin implementation of each microservice based on the selected architecture pattern.
- Set up infrastructure for service discovery and message broker.
- Implement and deploy each service independently, following the outlined architecture and communication patterns.
